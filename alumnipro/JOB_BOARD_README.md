## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the SQL script to create the necessary tables and sample data:
```bash
mysql -u your_username -p your_database < setup-job-board.sql
```

### 2. Backend Setup
The backend components are already integrated into the Spring Boot application:
- Models are in `demo/src/main/java/com/example/demo/model/`

- Services are in `demo/src/main/java/com/example/demo/service/`
- Controllers are in `demo/src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/`

### 3. Frontend Setup
The frontend components are integrated into the React application:
- Component: `frontend/src/components/JobBoard.js`
